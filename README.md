# AI Enabled Recommendation Engine for an E-commerce Platform

## Milestone 1: Data Preparation

### Objective
Prepare clean and structured datasets for model development.

### Description
In this milestone, a real-world Amazon Product Reviews dataset was used to collect user and product interaction data.
The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicate records, and resolving inconsistencies.
Only relevant attributes such as user ID, product ID, and rating were retained.

The cleaned data was transformed into a user–item interaction matrix, where rows represent users and columns represent products.
This matrix will be used in the next milestone to develop recommendation models.

### Tasks Completed
- Collected user and product interaction data
- Cleaned and structured the dataset
- Handled data inconsistencies
- Built the user–item interaction matrix

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Google Colab

### Dataset
- Amazon Product Reviews Dataset (Kaggle)
